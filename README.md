Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. Some of the distributed systems coordination problems that zookeeper solves: manage cluster membership, locks in distributed systems, and leader election. 
Apache Zookeeper solves these problems using a hierarchical namespace, much like a distributed file system. Every node in the namespace is referred to as a znode. Znodes maintain a stat structure that includes version numbers for data changes, ACL changes. The stat structure also has timestamps.
